# ToDo
- Add an event where the user can register and unregister events. 
The event system would use an annotation for the method.
For example:

```java
@Event
public void onDrawEvent(DrawEvent event) {
//code
}
```

- More entities, for example HumanEntity, EntityPlayer, etc. (also create a move method for LivingEntity)
- Updates and fixes to the Inventory system, I did it quickly and its not great but not horrible.
- Maybe make entity x and y doubles? (would cause trouble with drawing and lots of other stuff)
- Update and revise the tutorial
- Networking system in which the client and server could communicate via TCP. (No client trust for multiplayer games)
- 2D physics and particles.
- Improve world and tile, I feel im missing something and lots of things could be added.
