# Moved
Hello, I've decided to leave Lunar alone possibly forever. I've created a new library using all the things I learned while working on this one. Check it out [here](https://github.com/Vrekt/Stellar). Some things are currently missing but will be added soon. Thank you to everyone who contributed on this project, I truly do appreciate it, I've learned alot. If a piece of code is being used in Stellar that is yours contact me and Ill credit you. (I've tried to rewrite everything myself, but there is a small chance I've missed something).
